// var mul = function(a) {
//   return function(b) {
//     return function(c) {
//       return a * b * c; 
//     };
//   }; 
// }
// console.log(mul(2)(4)(5)); //setting up the function like this gives the inner function access to all variables a, b, and c and within a you return the anonymous function that takes b as a parameter, within b you return the anonymous function that takes c as a parameter (this could go on for as many inputs as you wanted to multiply together)
